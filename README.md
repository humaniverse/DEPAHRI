# DEPAHRI

## Overview
The Digital Exclusion and Physical Access to Healthcare Risk Index (DEPAHRI) indicates the overall difficulty of accessing healthcare services. Aside from assessing physical access to healthcare (GP's and hospitals), the DEPAHRI includes a measure of the risk of digital exclusion. Indeed, with the gradual growth of virtual wards (also known as hospital at home) which allow patients to get the care they need at home, measuring the risk of digital exclusion becomes increasingly important when assessing access to healthcare.

To reach this objective, the DEPAHRI Index is building on the ![DERI Index](https://github.com/GreaterManchesterODA/Digital-Exclusion-Risk-Index), an index of risk of digital exclusion across England, Wales and Scotland.
