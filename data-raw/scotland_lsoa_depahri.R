# A bespoke geographic information system application was used to calculate the road
# distance to the closest service from the population weighted centroid of each Output
# Area. To create an average road distance for the Lower-layer Super Output Area, a
# population-weighted mean of the Output Area road distances was used. Each Output Area
# score was weighted according to the proportion of the Lower-layer Super Output Area
# population that is within the Output Area, and the weighted scores summed. The Output
# Area level population estimates used for population-weighting were taken from mid-2017
# small area population estimates at Output Area level published by the Office for National
# Statistics.
